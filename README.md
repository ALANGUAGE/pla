####Properties and how to run
* look at properties.md,  German readers look at [Wikipedia](http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_language_A)
* files.md, description of all files.
* documentation.md, introduction for developers and collaborators.

####History
I (Helmut Guenther) started the project in MS-DOS times to learn how a compiler works.
As of 1.1.2015 I set the software as free software under the MIT license.
You find a very old version from 2009 here: http://sourceforge.net/projects/pla/
It includes with source compiler, command interpreter and the game [Towers of Hanoi](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_of_Hanoi).

####Home
Website: https://github.com/ALANGUAGE/pla  
Email: help@pla.de

It is my first free software and I am new to Github. Contrubutors are heartily wellcome! 
I am looking for comments, suggestions and of  course bugs. I start the documentation, which I have never done before and will explain the functions. If it holds interests to you, please come back or write me an email. Helmut Guenther pla@HelmutGuenther.de
####TODO
* I will write the documentation
* installing a mailing list, issues tracker

####Later
* I used no Version control system and printed out the code. 
So I wrote the code very dense. With the code folding features of the editors 
there is no need any more. Beautifying the code is necessary.
* remove the old Borland TASM code.
