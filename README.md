Programming Language A

####Goal
Assembly language with C style syntax for X86 processors with the freedom of assembly and the notation of the C language.
####License
The MIT License (MIT) starting 1.1.2015
####How to run
See at files.md. Start the small Batch file BA.BAT. The compiler compiles itself and calls the Netwide Assembler(NASM). 
For an introduction see at documentation.md.
####History
I (Helmut Guenther) started the project in MS-DOS times to learn how a compiler works.
As of 1.1.2015 I set the software as free software under the MIT license.
You find a very old version from 2009 here: http://sourceforge.net/projects/pla/
It includes with source compiler, command interpreter and the game [Towers of Hanoi](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_of_Hanoi).

It is my first free software and I am new to Github. Contrubutors are heartily wellcome! 
I am looking for comments, suggestions and of  course bugs. I start the documentation, which I have never done before and will explain the functions. If it holds interests to you, please come back or write me an Email until I find a better solution. 
####TODO
* porting to https://github.com/alanguage/A, if I know how to do
* I will write the documentation
* installing a mailing list, issues tracker

####Later
* I used no Version control system and printed out the code. 
So I wrote the code very dense. With the code folding features of the editors 
there is no need any more. Beautifying the code.
* remove the old Borland TASM code
