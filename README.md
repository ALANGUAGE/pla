It is my first free software and I am new to Github. Contrubutors are heartily wellcome! 
I am looking for comments, suggestions and of  course bugs. I start the documentation and will explain the design, all functions and variables. If it holds interests to you, please come back or write me an email.

####TODO
* writing the documentation
* installing a mailing list, issues tracker

####Later
I used no version control system and printed out the code. 
So I wrote the code very dense. With the code folding features of the editors 
there is no need any more. Beautifying the code is necessary.

####History
I (Helmut Guenther) started the project in MS-DOS times to learn how a compiler works.
As of 1.1.2015 I set the software as free software under the MIT license.
You find a very old version from 2009 here: http://sourceforge.net/projects/pla/
It includes with source compiler, command interpreter and the game [Towers of Hanoi](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_of_Hanoi).
